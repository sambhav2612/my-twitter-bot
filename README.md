I had a fantasy to create something that automates some tasks for me or for anyone. Last week, I've reading some article on [Medium](https://medium.com) about startups. In the suggested section, there was a article with title *["Build a Twitter Bot using NodeJS with 38 Lines of Code"](https://codeburst.io/build-a-simple-twitter-bot-with-node-js-in-just-38-lines-of-code-ed92db9eb078)*. I went in, thinking it'd be pretty hard to create something like a bot. But, it was easier to design a simple bot than to *write an algortihm to sort n-elements in O(n) time*.    
     
The concept behind the bot is pretty relative:     
1. You need to have a query (set of keyword/s) you need to search the tweets according to.
2. You need to have access to the Twitter API.
3. You must be lazy.    
    
**So, how did I accomplish this?**     
I had to sign up for a new account on Twiiter. Then, I went on [Twitter Apps](https://apps.twitter.com) and created a new app. Now, here's the important part: When you create an app on Twiiter they give your app unique IDs to differentiate from other apps running on Twitter. You may have to click Generate Access Token to create your access token.
